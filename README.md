# HiLoGuessingGame
Just a basic c++ college course coding challenge
This program is a console app where the user guesses
a random number from between a user selected range
within a user selected number of tries

The assignment was simply to write a high low guessing game
but I decided to embelish it into a more sophisticated ver
of what the assignment asked for to help me learn the concepts
